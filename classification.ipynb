    "### Dataset Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amazon Reviews** - The dataset is used for authorship identification in online Writeprint which is a new research field of pattern recognition.Dataset is derived from the customers' reviews in Amazon Commerce Website for authorship identification. To examine the robustness of clasification algorithms, dataset identified 50 of the most active users (represented by a unique ID and username) who frequently posted reviews in these newsgroups. The number of reviews we collected for each author is 30. Feature set includes authors' lingustic style such as usage of digit, punctuation, words and sentences' length and usage frequency of words and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Census Income** - This data set contains unweighted PUMS census data from the Los Angeles and Long Beach areas for the years 1970, 1980, and 1990. The task is to predict if the income is above or below a specified threshold of $50000 per year. The dataset consists of both nominal and continuous features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Cover Type** - The dataset provide information regarding the forest cover type. The feature included 12 measures, but 54 columns of data (10 quantitative variables, 4 binary wilderness areas and 40 binary soil type variables). The target labels is 7.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Github** - A large social network of GitHub developers which was collected from the public API in June 2019. Nodes are developers who have starred at least 10 repositories and edges are mutual follower relationships between them. The vertex features are extracted based on the location, repositories starred, employer and e-mail address. The task related to the graph is binary node classification - one has to predict whether the GitHub user is a web or a machine learning developer. This target feature was derived from the job title of each user.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Influenza Outbreak** - By identifying influenza-related tweets, the goal is to forecast the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza outbreaks for different locations and dates. The feature set comprises mainly of keywords pertaining to influenza.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Nomao** - Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. The datset consists of 34,465 instances, mix of continuous and nominal, labeled by human expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OCR** - The OCR dataset aims to classify handwritten digits using normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Spam** - The dataset can be used to classify whether an email is spam or not. The last column of 'spambase.data' denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail.  \n",
    "Most of the attributes indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occuring in the e-mail.  The run-length attributes (55-57) measure the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters."

    "### Algorithm Summary\n",
    "- **PCA** - One of the most common techniques for reducing dimension where the coveriance matrix of the features can be transformed into eigenvalue/eigenvector. Dimensionality can be reduced by selecting components with higher variance as the new features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **ICA** - Independent Component Analysis may look similar to PCA but is slightly different in the assumption that the independent component are assumed to be non-gaussian and the focus is on maximizing independence rather than correlation like PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kernal PCA** - Kernel PCA is an extension to PCA which uses kernel methods to perform linear transformation. This allows us to use different kernel function such as cosine, sigmoidal, exponentional to transform data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Mini Batch Dictionary Learning** - Dictionary learning a sparse-coding technique in which the goal is to determine basis components called atoms that can be used to mimic the original data point.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Truncated SVD** - Truncated SVD is an extension Singular Value Decomposition algorithm which uses a truncated U matrix to decompose the real matrix resulting in blazing fast dimension reduction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **NMF** - Non Negative Matrix Factorization is a similat technique to PCA and SVD but results in non-negative components.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** - Latent Dirichlet Allocation is originally used for topic-modelling but if we consider each topic as the new basis, the feature vector for each row can be expressed in terms of the topics.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Locally Linear Embedding** -  Locally Linear Embedding works by determining linear mapping—consisting\n",
    "of a translation, rotation, and rescaling that maps the high dimensional coordinates of each neighborhood to global internal coordinates on the manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MDS** - Multi-dimensional Scaling aims to reduce dimensionality by transforming the data into a lower dimension ensuring that the pairwise distance between each instance is maintained across the transformation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **t-SNE** - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding is non-linear dimension reduction technique with goals of placing similar datapoints together. t-SNE was geared towards visualizng high dimensional data and therefore, works well with components <= 3\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Linear Discriminant Analysis** - Linear Discriminant Analysis although similar to PCA is supervised dimensionality reduction technique and the goal is to maximize the separation between different classes. In its implementation the algorithm requires the number of components to be equal to the number of classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Spectral Embedding** - Spectral Embedding is another non-linear dimensionality reduction technique which uses Laplacian Eigenmaps for the transformation. Laplacian Eigenmaps ensures preservation of local geometry in the data. It relies on the basic assumption the the high dimensional data lies in the low dimensional manifold.\n"
