    "### Dataset Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blog Comment Count Prediction** - Based on the features extracted from a post, the task was to predict the number of comments it would receive. The feature vector included features like number of comments within 24 hours and 200 bag of words features as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buzz Events** - The dataset contains data related to two social media platforms, Twitter and Tom's Hardware. The task was to predict buzz generated which was represented by the mean number of display for the instance (post)'s topic. The dataset included features like number of discussions created, burstiness level and other such features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Violent Crime** - Communities in the US. Data combines socio-economic data from the '90 Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Admin Stats survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR. The dataset has 125 predictive, 4 non-predictive, 18 potential goal features.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **CT Slice** -  The dataset consists of 384 features extracted from CT images. The class variable is numeric and denotes the relative location of the CT slice on the axial axis of the human body. The feature set consist of Histogram describing bone structures and air inclusions. The target column is the Relative location of the image on the axial axis in the range [0; 180] where 0 denotes the top of the head and 180 the soles of the feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Facebook Comments Volume** - Instances in this dataset contain features extracted from facebook posts. The task associated with the data is to predict how many comments the post will receive. In terms of goal, it is very similar to the first dataset but instead of bag of words features, the feature set comprises of most temporal information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indoor Location** - The UJIIndoorLoc is a Multi-Building Multi-Floor indoor localization database to test Indoor Positioning System that rely on WLAN/WiFi fingerprint. The dataset provides multiple target columns to define the location in 3 dimensional space including classification targets like building and floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy** - Experimental data used to create regression models of appliances energy use in a low energy building. The feature set consist of temperature and humidity readings in various rooms apat from some other environmental variables."

    "### Algorithm Summary\n",
    "- **PCA** - One of the most common techniques for reducing dimension where the coveriance matrix of the features can be transformed into eigenvalue/eigenvector. Dimensionality can be reduced by selecting components with higher variance as the new features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **ICA** - Independent Component Analysis may look similar to PCA but is slightly different in the assumption that the independent component are assumed to be non-gaussian and the focus is on maximizing independence rather than correlation like PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kernal PCA** - Kernel PCA is an extension to PCA which uses kernel methods to perform linear transformation. This allows us to use different kernel function such as cosine, sigmoidal, exponentional to transform data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Mini Batch Dictionary Learning** - Dictionary learning a sparse-coding technique in which the goal is to determine basis components called atoms that can be used to mimic the original data point.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Truncated SVD** - Truncated SVD is an extension Singular Value Decomposition algorithm which uses a truncated U matrix to decompose the real matrix resulting in blazing fast dimension reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NMF** - Non Negative Matrix Factorization is a similat technique to PCA and SVD but results in non-negative components.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** - Latent Dirichlet Allocation is originally used for topic-modelling but if we consider each topic as the new basis, the feature vector for each row can be expressed in terms of the topics.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Locally Linear Embedding** -  Locally Linear Embedding works by determining linear mapping—consisting\n",
    "of a translation, rotation, and rescaling that maps the high dimensional coordinates of each neighborhood to global internal coordinates on the manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MDS** - Multi-dimensional Scaling aims to reduce dimensionality by transforming the data into a lower dimension ensuring that the pairwise distance between each instance is maintained across the transformation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **t-SNE** - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding is non-linear dimension reduction technique with goals of placing similar datapoints together. t-SNE was geared towards visualizng high dimensional data and therefore, works well with components <= 3\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Linear Discriminant Analysis** - Linear Discriminant Analysis although similar to PCA is supervised dimensionality reduction technique and the goal is to maximize the separation between different classes. In its implementation the algorithm requires the number of components to be equal to the number of classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Spectral Embedding** - Spectral Embedding is another non-linear dimensionality reduction technique which uses Laplacian Eigenmaps for the transformation. Laplacian Eigenmaps ensures preservation of local geometry in the data. It relies on the basic assumption the the high dimensional data lies in the low dimensional manifold.\n"
